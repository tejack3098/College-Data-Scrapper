# College-Data-Scrapper
 
The College Data Scraper is a web application that scrapes data from college websites and creates a dataset of various features of the college such as the number of faculty, student intake, placement activity, social and sports achievements, and more. This dataset can be used by students to decide which college is best suited for them for admission as per their area of interest.

## Technologies Used:

- Python
- Flask
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Methodology:
- The College Data Scraper uses web scraping techniques to extract information from college websites. It uses Python programming language, along with libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests, to scrape data from the HTML format of the websites.

- The application sends an HTTP request to the URL of the webpage to access it. Once the HTML content is accessed, the data is parsed and transformed from unstructured data to structured data. For parsing, the application uses html5lib, which is an advanced HTML parser library, and for navigating and searching the parse tree, it uses BeautifulSoup, a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.

- The scraped data is then organized into a dataset, which can be used by students to compare colleges and choose the best option for them.

The College Data Scraper is a valuable tool for students who are in the process of choosing a college. It provides a dataset of various features of different colleges, which can be used to make an informed decision. The project involved learning and implementing web scraping techniques, using Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project is further extendable to include additional features and make it more user-friendly.
